LeftOvers has been around for almost one and half a year. During that time, we have made some progress in becoming known by other folks in information security. This is the first time that we actually shed some light on who we are and what we do. Main point of this blog post is to give out some tips in forming a hacking team/group/whatever and not just circle-jerk the LeftOvers.

# LeftOvers
We were founded by people, who used to work at KPMG Finland together at some point. Eventhough our paths went separate at some point in life, we enjoyed each others company and bad humour. We started collaborating in [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu) and after a while we started joining CTFs, Hackathons/Hackdays and some bug bounty programs together. Now, ~a year later, we have people from multiple different companies _(as of February 2020)_;

- Detectify
- Elisa
- F-Secure
- KPMG Finland
- Nixu
- Secureworks
- Solita

We have participated in following events as a team:

- Sanoma Pro Hackday 2019
- LÃ¤hiTapiola Hackday 2019
- Nokia Hackathon 2020

## Gathering the people
Like I said before, everyone at LeftOvers used to work together at some point. Lucky for us, the KPMG alumni are active folks and love to get together to have some beers. For us it was relevantly easy to find the like-minded people. We weren't really actively looking for anyone, but somehow we had folks wanting to form a team together. We weren't looking for any kinds of special skills, only people who are willing to have fun and hack.

If you are currently in the looks for a team, a logical place would be to look around at your own workplace for someone who is looking for a team as well. 

## Coming up with a name
LeftOvers is a nice name. In some events, people have thought that we are people, who couldn't find a team, but wanted to participate anyways ~~(which is somewhat true for us)~~. It was not the first name we came up with, but first real public one. One other idea was _H*ckers_, but that didn't catch wind. I think there is no best practice for coming up with names. My recommendation is something that can be easily pronounced and somewhat short. If you have a story about the name, the more meaning is behind it. 

## Having fun


## Getting paid
At some point all the fun that you have, might turn profitable. At the events, you might get loads of money out of the vulnerabilities you find. At that point how you divide the money can be an awkward discussion. You might be a team that is looking to make big bucks and then the money can be an issue. In the heat of the moment, it is hard to keep track that who found what vulnerability. At all three events that LeftOvers has participated, we've divided money equal to the event participants. If the payout is small, some of us have opted to put the money in to christmas party funds.
