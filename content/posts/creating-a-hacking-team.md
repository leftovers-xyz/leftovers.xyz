LeftOvers has been around for almost one and half a year. During that time, we have made some progress in becoming known by other folks in information security. This is the first time that we actually shed some light on who we are and what we do. Main point of this blog post is to give out some tips in forming a hacking team/group/whatever and not just circle-jerk the LeftOvers.

# LeftOvers
We were founded by people, who used to work at KPMG Finland together at some point. Eventhough our paths went separate at some point in life, we enjoyed each others company and bad humour. We started collaborating in [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu) and after a while we started joining CTFs, Hackathons/Hackdays and some bug bounty programs together. Now, ~a year later, we have people from multiple different companies _(as of January 2020)_;

- KPMG Finland
- Nixu
- Solita
- F-Secure
- Secureworks

## Gathering the people
Like I said before, everyone at LeftOvers used to work together at some point. Lucky for us, the alumni are active folks and love to get together to have some beers. For us it was relevantly easy to find the like-minded people. We weren't really actively looking for anyone, but somehow we had folks wanting to form a team together. We weren't looking for any kinds of special skills, only people who are willing to have fun and hack.

## Coming up with a name
LeftOvers is a nice name. In some events, people have thought that we are people, who couldn't find a team, but wanted to participate anyways ~~(which is somewhat true for us)~~.

## Having fun
Get stickers and hoodies.
