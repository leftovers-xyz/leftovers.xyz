LeftOvers has been around for almost one and half a year. During that time, we have made some progress in becoming known by other folks in information security. This is the first time that we actually shed some light on who we are and what we do. Main point of this blog post is to give out some tips in forming a hacking team/group/whatever and not just circle-jerk the LeftOvers.

# LeftOvers
We were founded by people, who used to work at KPMG Finland together at some point. Eventhough our paths went separate at some point in life, we enjoyed each others company and bad humour. We started collaborating in [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu) and after a while we started joining CTFs, Hackathons/Hackdays and some bug bounty programs together. Now, ~a year later, we have people from multiple different companies _(as of February 2020)_;

- Detectify
- Elisa
- F-Secure
- KPMG Finland
- Nixu
- Secureworks
- Solita

We have participated in following events as a team:

- Sanoma Pro Hackday 2019
- LähiTapiola Hackday 2019
- Nokia Hackathon 2020

# Hacking team
This blog post is mostly about non-commercial hacking teams, that don't do it as a full-time job. Many companies of course provide hacking services for their customers and have dedicated teams for that, but I'd 

Other notable Finnish hacking teams

- [Team ROT](https://teamrot.fi/)
- [Team Whack](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Whack_%E2%80%93_kaikki_on_hakkeroitavissa)
- [PinkHatHackers](https://twitter.com/pinkhathackers)
- [Pystyy Vetää](https://pystyyvetaa.fi/)

## Gathering the people
Like I said before, everyone at LeftOvers used to work together at some point. Lucky for us, the KPMG alumni are active folks and love to get together to have some beers. For us it was relevantly easy to find the like-minded people. We weren't really actively looking for anyone, but somehow we had folks wanting to form a team together. We weren't looking for any kinds of special skills, only people who are willing to have fun and hack.

If you are currently in the looks for a team, a logical place would be to look around at your own workplace for someone who is looking for a team as well. I've seen multiple student groups that have formed a hacking team for fun. You just need to keep your eyes and ears open. Sometimes you have to open your mouth to form the team.

## Coming up with a name
LeftOvers is a nice name. In some events, people have thought that we are people, who couldn't find a team, but wanted to participate anyways ~~(which is somewhat true for us)~~. It was not the first name we came up with, but first real public one. One other idea was _H*ckers_, but that didn't catch wind.

I think there is no best practice for coming up with names. My recommendation is something that can be easily pronounced and somewhat short. If you have a story about the name, the more meaning is behind it. For example, there is a fun little story behind [Pystyy Vetää](https://pystyyvetaa.fi/) and [PinkHatHackers](https://twitter.com/pinkhathackers) as well. Ask about it from them, if you can catch them!

## Participating in events
In Finland, there are a few companies who organize hacking events, in which you get to participate by just signing up. Here are a few to keep an eye out for:

- LähiTapiola Hackday
- Sanoma Hackday
- Nokia Hackathon
- Traficom organized events (for example 5G hackathon)

Keep in mind, that in Finland there are two types of hackathons. The first one is the events, where you hack stuff (like the small list I just mentioned). The second is where you innovate and maybe might deliver a proof-of-concept about your innovation idea, common in coding hackathons.

## Having fun
The reason why some might create a team is to have fun. That is what happened with LeftOvers. After creating the team, we've had hacking themed summer day event and a christmas party. Apart from those, all the hackdays we've participated have been a lot of fun. 

To further improve your team spirit, it is recommended to get some swag for your team! LeftOvers have ordered some hoodies and stickers. My recommendation for stickers is [StickerApp](https://stickerapp.fi). Relatively cheap, but can still be costly if you order more than the minimum amount.

## Getting paid
At some point all the fun that you have might turn profitable. At the events, you might get loads of money out of the vulnerabilities you find. At that point how you divide the money can be an awkward discussion. You might be a team that is looking to make big bucks and then the money can be an issue. In the heat of the moment, it is hard to keep track that who found what vulnerability. At all three events that LeftOvers has participated, we've divided money equal to the event participants. If the payout is small, some of us have opted to put the money in to christmas party funds.
